# SUBHA INFRA — Image Library & Website CMS

A free, Google-hosted CMS that controls **every managed image on www.subhainfra.com**.

```
 Admin (browser)  ──►  Apps Script web app  ──►  Google Sheet  (database: 11 tables)
                              │                  Google Drive  (image files, one folder per category)
                              ▼
            ?api=site  (published image list, JSON, cached)
                              ▲
 Visitor's browser ── /js/cms.js on every page swaps in the published images
                     (the images built into the HTML stay as the fallback)
```

| Piece | Where |
|---|---|
| Apps Script code (paste into script.google.com) | `apps-script/` → `Code.gs`, `Seed.gs`, `Admin.html`, `Styles.html`, `App.html`, `appsscript.json` |
| Website loader | `/js/cms.js` (loaded on every page by `_build/partials/footer.html`) |
| Website switch | `/js/site-config.js` → `cmsApi` |
| Where every image is | `IMAGE-MAP.md` (text) and `image-map.html` (thumbnails — open in a browser) |
| Generator | `generate-cms.ps1` — tags the pages, assigns image IDs, writes `Seed.gs` and the maps |

---

## 1. Two kinds of number

| | Example | What it identifies | Changes? |
|---|---|---|---|
| **Image ID** | `PEB-001` | one photo (one file) | Never. Not reset, not reused after deletion, kept when the file is replaced or the image is moved to another category. |
| **Placement key** | `HOME-HERO-1` | one fixed spot on the website | Never. In the HTML: `<img data-slot="HOME-HERO-1">` |
| **Project number** | `PRJ-001` | one project | Never. |

An image can fill any number of placements without copying the file. Every image row also has a permanent database `uid` (UUID).

The 59 photos already on the site were numbered: `ARCH-001…029` (21 residential + 8 commercial), `FACADE-001…005`, `PEB-001…004`, `STEEL-001…002`, `TENS-001`, `INT-001…009`, `PROC-001…008` (design journey), `TEAM-001`. The 41 portfolio projects are `PRJ-001…041` in website order. The site has **170 placements** on 20 pages and menus. See `IMAGE-MAP.md`.

> **Found during the inventory:** all 9 interior-gallery photos (`INT-001…009`) and all 8 design-journey photos (`PROC-001…008`) are byte-identical copies of exterior project photos. For example, the "Living room interior" image is actually a villa exterior. They are flagged "placeholder copy" in the CMS. Use **Replace** to swap in real photos; their IDs and placements stay the same.

### Finding any image

- **On the live site:** add `?cms_labels=1` to any page URL (for example `https://www.subhainfra.com/services/peb-structures/?cms_labels=1`). Every managed image then shows a badge with its *placement key · image ID*; click a badge to copy it. Use `?cms_labels=0` to turn the badges off.
- **In the admin:** *All Placements* lists every spot page by page, and every card in the *Image Library* lists the placements it fills. The ↗ button on a placement opens the live page scrolled to that spot and outlined.
- **Offline:** `IMAGE-MAP.md` / `image-map.html`.

---

## 2. Set up (about 15 minutes, once)

Use the Google account that should own the images (ideally a company Gmail account such as `subhainfra.web@gmail.com`).

1. Open **https://script.google.com** → **New project**. Rename it `SUBHA INFRA CMS`.
2. **Project Settings** (⚙) → tick **Show "appsscript.json" manifest file in editor**. Back in the Editor, open `appsscript.json` and replace its contents with `apps-script/appsscript.json`.
3. Create the files. The names must match exactly; the editor adds `.gs` / `.html` itself.
   - `Code.gs` → paste `apps-script/Code.gs`
   - **+ → Script** named `Seed` → paste `apps-script/Seed.gs`
   - **+ → HTML** named `Admin` → paste `apps-script/Admin.html`
   - **+ → HTML** named `Styles` → paste `apps-script/Styles.html`
   - **+ → HTML** named `App` → paste `apps-script/App.html`

   *Or with clasp:* `npm i -g @google/clasp`, `clasp login`, then `clasp create --type standalone --title "SUBHA INFRA CMS" --rootDir _build/cms/apps-script` and `clasp push`.
4. Select the function **`setup`** in the toolbar and press **Run**. Approve the permissions. Google shows "unverified app" because it is your own script: choose **Advanced → Go to SUBHA INFRA CMS**.
   The **Execution log** prints the database link, the Drive folder, your login email and a **temporary password**.
5. **Deploy → New deployment →** type **Web app**:
   - Execute as: **Me**
   - Who has access: **Anyone** (the website must be able to read the published image list; the admin panel has its own login)

   Press **Deploy** and copy the **Web app URL** (it ends in `/exec`).
6. Open the URL, sign in, then go to **Settings → Change my password**.
7. **Connect the website:** in `js/site-config.js` set
   ```js
   cmsApi: 'https://script.google.com/macros/s/XXXXXXXX/exec',
   ```
   (Settings in the admin shows this exact line with a Copy button.)
8. Upload the website files to your hosting as usual. Files changed by this CMS work:
   every page `index.html` (rebuilt with `data-slot` keys), `js/cms.js` (new), `js/main.js`, `js/site-config.js`.
9. Check it: open `https://www.subhainfra.com/?cms_labels=1`. Badges should show image IDs (for example `HOME-HERO-1 · PEB-001`).

**Updating the Apps Script code later:** paste the new code, then **Deploy → Manage deployments → ✎ edit → Version: New version → Deploy**. The URL stays the same. A *New deployment* creates a different URL.

**Locked out?** In the editor, run `resetOwnerPassword`. The log prints a new temporary password.

## 3. Everyday workflow

| Step | Where |
|---|---|
| 1. Sign in | the web app URL |
| 2. Open **Image Library** | sidebar |
| 3. Upload 20 warehouse photos | **Upload images**, or drag files onto the library |
| 4–5. Choose **PEB Structures** › **Industrial Sheds** | upload dialog (it shows the numbers they will get) |
| 6. Numbers are assigned automatically, e.g. `PEB-005 … PEB-024` | server, under a lock: never duplicated |
| 7. Select the images | they are pre-selected after upload (**Show & select uploaded images**) |
| 8. Assign | **Place on website** (choose page → spot), or the **Landing Page** / **Services Pages** views (click a spot, or drag from the image tray), or **Add to project** in the bulk bar |
| 9. **Preview**, then **Publish** | top bar |
| 10. The website updates | new visitors immediately; returning visitors within `cmsCacheMinutes` (10 min) |

| Action | What happens |
|---|---|
| **Save as draft** | Every edit is saved immediately as a draft. The live site does not change. |
| **Preview** | Opens the real site showing drafts, in your browser only (`?cms_preview=…`). A bar marks preview mode. |
| **Publish** | Writes a new version of the published image list. |
| **Unpublish** | Switch a project's *Published* toggle off (its card leaves the portfolio grid), or press ✕ on a placement (it returns to its built-in image), then Publish. |
| **Replace** | Uploads a new file under the same ID. Every placement follows after Publish. The old file goes to the Drive trash. |
| **Archive / Inactive** | Hidden from the website. A placement using it falls back to its built-in image, and the dashboard warns you. |
| **Delete** | If the image is in use, you get a warning listing every placement and project first. The file goes to the Drive trash (recoverable for 30 days) and the ID is retired. |

---

## 4. Image storage & optimisation

- **Upload:** the browser resizes to max **2400 px** and converts to **WebP** (quality 0.86) before uploading, so files are typically 60–80% smaller with no visible loss. If the original is already smaller, it is kept as is. Older Safari versions without WebP encoding fall back to JPEG 90%. Both values are set in **Settings**.
- **Delivery:** Drive images are served from Google's image CDN at the exact width needed. `cms.js` writes a responsive `srcset` (480, 800, 1200, 1600, 2000 and 2400 px, up to the original width) with `sizes` matched to each placement, so phones download small files and 4K screens get sharp ones. Thumbnails in the admin use 320–640 px.
- **Lazy loading:** existing `loading="lazy"` / `fetchpriority` attributes are kept. `width`/`height` are updated where the page sets them (no layout shift).
- **Fallback:** if the CMS cannot be reached (within 8 s), the image built into the page stays. SEO is unchanged because crawlers still see the built-in `<img>` and its alt text.
- **URL template:** `https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/d/{id}=w{w}`. If Google ever changes this, switch it in Settings to `https://drive.google.com/thumbnail?id={id}&sz=w{w}` and Publish.

## 5. Database schema (Google Sheet — one tab per table)

All cells are stored as plain text. Never rename columns.

| Table | Columns | Notes |
|---|---|---|
| `images` | uid, image_id, prefix, seq, original_filename, display_name, category_code, subcategory, project_no, source, file_id, url, alt_text, width, height, bytes, mime, upload_date, updated_at, display_order, status, notes | `source` = `drive` (uploaded) or `site` (original website file in `url`). `status` = active · inactive · archived · deleted (deleted rows are kept so IDs are never reused). |
| `image_categories` | code, name, group, service_url, sort | `code` is the ID prefix. |
| `image_subcategories` | id, category_code, name, sort | Renaming updates the images that use it. |
| `website_sections` | slot_key, page, page_url, section, label, recommended_w, recommended_h, sizes, sort, source_file | One row per placement (from `Seed.gs`). |
| `image_assignments` | slot_key, image_id, updated_at, updated_by | Draft choice per placement. Empty = built-in image. |
| `projects` | project_no, slug, name, category, location, description, featured_image_id, status, year, featured, published, sort, updated_at | `slug` = existing page `/projects/<slug>/`. |
| `project_images` | project_no, image_id, role, sort | role = gallery · before · after. |
| `administrators` | email, name, role, salt, password_hash, active, last_login, created_at | role = owner · editor. |
| `website_settings` | key, value | site_url, image_url_template, upload_max_px, webp_quality, published_version, published_at, published_by |
| `counters` | prefix, last_seq | Next number = max(last_seq, highest used) + 1. |
| `audit_log` | time, user, action, details | Every upload, change, publish and login. |
| `enquiries` | id, time, name, phone, email, service, location, message, source, page, status, notes, updated_at, updated_by | Website contact form + pop-up. `id` = ENQ-0001…; `status` = New · Contacted · Site visit · Quoted · Won · Closed. Created automatically on the first enquiry. |

The published version is also saved as `published.json` in the Drive folder and cached in Apps Script (CacheService, chunked, 6 h).

Editing the Sheet by hand is possible but skips the checks. Afterwards, run `republish` in the editor to push the change live.

## 6. API

**Public** — `GET <web app URL>?api=site`
```jsonc
{
  "ok": true, "v": 12, "at": "2026-11-08T10:15:00Z",
  "tpl": "https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/d/{id}=w{w}",
  "slots": {
    "HOME-HERO-1": { "i": "HOME-001", "d": "<drive file id>", "w": 2400, "h": 1350, "a": "alt text", "t": "name", "c": "Landing Page", "s": "100vw" },
    "NAV-SVC-PEB": { "i": "PEB-001", "u": "/assets/project-images/subha-infra-peb-structures-01.jpg", "w": 1600, "h": 900, … }
  },
  "projects": {
    "angular-white-villa": { "no": "PRJ-021", "pub": 1, "f": 0, "img": { …image… }, "gal": [ { …image…, "r": "Before" } ], "loc": "Bengaluru" }
  }
}
```
`d` = Drive file (URL built from `tpl`), `u` = original website file. Only *active* images are included. A placement that is missing from the list keeps its built-in image.

- `GET ?api=site&mode=draft&token=<admin session>` returns the same shape with unpublished drafts (used by Preview).
- `GET ?api=health` returns `{ ok, version, ready }`.

**Public** — `POST <web app URL>?api=enquiry` (body: JSON sent as text/plain, so browsers need no CORS pre-flight)
```jsonc
{ "name": "Ravi", "phone": "+91 98450 12345", "email": "", "service": "Interior design", "location": "Bengaluru", "message": "…", "source": "Pop-up", "page": "/", "t": 9000, "website": "" }
```
→ `{ ok: true, id: "ENQ-0007" }` or `{ ok: false, error }`. Saved to the `enquiries` sheet and emailed to *Settings → Send enquiry emails to* (empty = the owner account). Spam protection: hidden `website` field, minimum fill time (`t` ≥ 1.5 s), 20 per minute overall, 3 per hour per phone number.

**Admin** — `google.script.run.rpc(token, action, args)` → `{ ok, data | error }`, after `login(email, password)` → `{ ok, token, user }`. Sessions last 6 hours.

| Action | args |
|---|---|
| bootstrap | — (images, categories, placements, projects, pending changes, settings) |
| uploadImage | name, mime, data (base64), width, height, category_code, subcategory, project_no, add_to_gallery, role, display_name, alt_text, status |
| replaceImage | image_id, name, mime, data, width, height |
| updateImage / bulkUpdate | image_id / ids, fields {display_name, alt_text, category_code, subcategory, project_no, status, notes} |
| setOrder | ids (display order) |
| imageUsage / deleteImages | image_id / ids, force |
| assignSlot | slot_key, image_id ('' = built-in) |
| saveProject / deleteProject / setProjectImages | project {…} / project_no / project_no, items [{image_id, role}] |
| saveCategory / saveSubcategory / deleteSubcategory | code, name, group, isNew / category_code, name, id / id |
| publish, downloadZip (ids, max 40), saveSettings, listAdmins, saveAdmin, changePassword, auditLog | |
| listEnquiries / updateEnquiry | — / id, status, notes |

Write actions run under a script lock, one at a time.

## 7. Adding a new image spot to the website (developer)

1. Add the `<img>` to the page in `_build/pages/…` (or a partial).
2. Add a line for it to that page's table in `generate-cms.ps1` (the format is `KEY|Section · Item`). The script refuses to run if the number of `<img>` tags and table lines differ.
3. Run:
   ```powershell
   powershell -ExecutionPolicy Bypass -File _build\cms\generate-cms.ps1
   powershell -ExecutionPolicy Bypass -File _build\build.ps1
   ```
4. Paste the new `apps-script/Seed.gs` (and any changed `Code.gs` / `App.html` / `Styles.html`) into the Apps Script project and run **`syncWebsite`**. It adds new images, placements and categories, points every placement *nobody changed in the admin panel* to its new image, keeps every choice you made, retires unused old placeholder files and publishes. The execution log lists exactly what changed.
5. Upload the site.

Logos and the favicon are deliberately *not* managed (brand assets).

---

## 7b. Making admin-panel photos permanent in the website files

New photos chosen in the admin panel live in Google Drive and are swapped in by `js/cms.js`. To copy the published choices into the website itself (faster first paint, works without the CMS, better for Google Images):

```powershell
powershell -ExecutionPolicy Bypass -File _build\cms\sync-images.ps1 -WhatIf   # preview
powershell -ExecutionPolicy Bypass -File _build\cms\sync-images.ps1          # do it
```
It downloads each changed photo to `assets/cms/<IMAGE-ID>.webp`, points the matching `<img data-slot>` (and team photos in `js/site-config.js`) at it, moves old files nobody uses any more to `_build/cms/replaced/<date>/`, and rebuilds with the current base path. Then push / upload the site as usual.

---

## 8. Free-tier limits (personal Google account, no cost)

| Service | Limit | What it means here |
|---|---|---|
| Google Drive | 15 GB, shared with Gmail and Photos | About 30,000 optimised photos (~500 KB each) |
| Google Sheets | 10 million cells | ~450,000 image rows |
| Apps Script run time | 6 min per request | One upload is about 2–4 s; publish is under 10 s |
| Apps Script concurrency | 30 simultaneous requests | Each visitor calls the API at most once per 10 min (browser cache), and the answer comes from cache, so this is ample for a corporate site |
| UrlFetch | 20,000 / day | Only used by "Download" for original website files |
| Email (MailApp) | 100 recipients / day | One email per website enquiry |
| CacheService | 100 KB per key, 6 h | The published list is split into chunks automatically |
| Image CDN (`lh3.googleusercontent.com`) | Not a documented Google product | Widely used, but Google could change it. Switch the template in Settings if it ever stops working. |

No paid services are used. If traffic ever grows very large, the published JSON (`published.json` in Drive) can be copied to the web host and `cmsApi` pointed at it.

## 9. Security

- Passwords are salted and hashed (SHA-256, 200 rounds). Sessions are random 64-character tokens that expire after 6 h. 5 failed logins lock that email for 15 minutes.
- Roles: **owner** (also settings and administrators) and **editor** (images, placements, projects, publish).
- Uploaded images are viewable by anyone who has the link, which is required to show them on a public website. Keep private documents out of the CMS Drive folder.
- The Sheet and Drive folder belong to the deploying account. Share them only with people you would trust as owners.

## 10. Not covered (by design, or still to do)

- **Text content** (team names, testimonials, SEO titles, contact details, rates) is still edited in `js/site-config.js` and `_build/pages`. The CMS manages images and project visibility, location and photos.
- **Brand-new project pages:** the CMS stores new projects (PRJ-042…) and their photos, but a new page at `/projects/<slug>/` still needs an entry in `_build/build.ps1` and a rebuild. Existing pages keep their URLs.
- **First visit:** a visitor's first page view shows the built-in image while the CMS list loads, then swaps (usually under a second). After that the list is cached, so the swap is near-instant.
